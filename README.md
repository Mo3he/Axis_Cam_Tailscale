## 📥 Installation

The recommended way is to use the **prebuilt `.eap` file** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Mo3he/Axis_Cam_Tailscale/releases).

1. Log into your Axis camera.  
2. Go to **Apps → Add App**.  
3. Upload the `.eap` file.  

Once installed:
- Start the app. 
- Click **Open** to view logs and get your Tailscale authentication URL.  
- On uninstall, all changes/files are removed.  

> ⚠️ You’ll need a [Tailscale account](https://tailscale.com/) to authenticate.

---

## 🚀 Usage

- Runs a startup script to set permissions and launch Tailscale.  
- View logs via the **Open** button in the app.  
- Authenticate using the provided URL.  

---

## 🔄 Updating Tailscale

- New `.eap` files are auto-built and released **weekly** (if a new Tailscale version is available).  
- To update, simply install the new `.eap` over the existing one.  

### Manual update (advanced)

Replace the binaries in the `lib/` folder:
- `tailscale`
- `tailscaled`

Download the latest versions: [Tailscale static builds](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#static)

#### Build locally

From the main directory of the version you want (`arm` / `aarch64`):

```bash
docker build --tag <package_name> .
docker cp $(docker create <package_name>):/opt/app ./build
```

---

## 🧪 Testers Needed

A new **custom** version is available:
- Allows setting a custom server and auth key (for [Headscale](https://headscale.net/)).  
- Go to **Settings (⋮ → Settings)** to add your details.   

Please give it a try and share your feedback!

---

## 🎉 Good News

Tailscale ACAP can now run **without root privileges**, making it compatible with **Axis OS 12+**.  

- Runs in **user space networking mode**.  
- Limitation: the camera cannot initiate connections to other Tailscale nodes (but can still be accessed).  

For **full networking features**, use the **ROOT** version on Axis OS < 12.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Adding a VPN client directly to the camera enables:  
- Secure remote access without additional hardware or complex network configuration.  
- Easy setup through Tailscale’s lightweight WireGuard-based tunnel.

```

> Replace `<device_ip>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with your device credentials.  
> Enclose your password in quotes `' '` if it contains special characters.
